# **Project about Ethical Hacking**
This project is a Python tool that employs ethical hacking methods to conduct directory and subdirectory enumeration on a given domain.

## **Getting Started**
You must have python 3 downloaded on ur computer in order to run this code. You can download python from their original website https://www.python.org/downloads/

## **How to use it**
To run the script, first of all you must get the path of the directory of where the script is saved and navigate it on your shell. Next run the following command :
python3 test_scripting.py url     
url is the url of the website u want to perform unemeration on.
The script will output the valid directories, subdomains and files that it finds and store them in seperate files named output_dirs.bat, output_subdomains, and output_files, respectively.

## **Contributing**
